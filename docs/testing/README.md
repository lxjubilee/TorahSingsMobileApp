# JubiLujah Mobile App — Test-Case Suite

This directory holds the full pre-release validation suite for the JubiLujah mobile
app (Expo SDK 54 / React Native 0.81.5, Old Architecture, app version `2.0.x`).

Every screen, user flow, API integration, and edge case is covered across
**positive, negative, boundary, UI/UX, functional, integration, performance,
security, compatibility, and regression** scenarios. Each case is written in full
form — ID, category, priority, preconditions, numbered steps, and expected result.

## How to read this suite

- Start with [00-conventions.md](00-conventions.md) — it defines the **ID scheme**,
  **category tags**, **priority levels**, the **precondition glossary**, and the
  standard **boundary values** referenced throughout.
- Each numbered file is one functional area. Run a file top-to-bottom; preconditions
  are stated per case so they can also be run individually.
- Cases tagged **⚠ NOT WIRED IN V1** describe features whose code exists but is not
  reachable/functional in the shipping build. Their "Expected Result" documents the
  *current* correct behavior (unreachable / no-op), so QA does not raise false bugs.

## Environment & test-data prerequisites

**Build**: The app **requires a development/production build** — `react-native-track-player`
is a native module absent from Expo Go, so **all playback, analytics, and gate cases
fail silently (no-op) in Expo Go**. Use `expo prebuild` + `expo run:android` /
`run:ios`, or an EAS `development`/`preview` build. UI-only cases can be previewed in
Expo Go but must be finally validated on a real build.

**Backends** (configured in `app.json` → `expo.extra`):
- CDN catalog manifest — `https://cdn.jubileeverse.com` (anonymous)
- Unified jubilujah-api — `https://api.jubilujah.com` (Bearer JWT, powers auth,
  likes, playlists, reviews, analytics, listening gate, entitlement, mobile config)
- jubileeverse REST — `https://api.jubileeverse.com/v1` (`DATA_SOURCE='api'`, not used in prod)

**Test accounts needed**:
- A **Free-plan** account (to exercise the daily playback limit / gate).
- A **Paid-plan** account (unlimited playback).
- An account with **2FA enabled** and one **without**.
- A **fresh/unused email** for each sign-up run (sign-up creates a real account).
- An account with **existing likes, playlists, reviews** for populated-state cases.
- An account with **no user data** for empty-state cases.

**Devices** (compatibility matrix, see 29-nonfunctional.md): at minimum one iOS phone,
one Android phone, one tablet; oldest and newest supported OS of each.

**Network tooling**: ability to simulate offline / slow / server-error responses
(e.g. Charles/Proxyman, airplane mode, or a staging backend returning 401/500).
