### JLM-HOME-002 — Initial loading state
**Category:** UI/UX · **Priority:** P1 · **Platform:** Both
**Preconditions:** Catalog cold (first launch), Online.
**Steps:**

**Category:** UI/UX · **Priority:** P2 · **Platform:** Both
**Preconditions:** Home populated with ≥ 2 heroes.
**Steps:**
1. Watch the hero auto-advance; then swipe manually.

**Expected Result:** The visible rails filter to the selected category; the "All"/Home chip
restores the full feed.

---

### JLM-HOME-010 — Collapsing header hides chips on scroll-down, shows on scroll-up
**Category:** UI/UX, Regression · **Priority:** P1 · **Platform:** Both
**Preconditions:** Home populated (scrollable).
**Steps:**
1. Scroll down, then up.
**Expected Result:** Category chips collapse/hide on downward scroll and reappear on upward
scroll; header background cross-fades from transparent to solid as content scrolls under it.

---

### JLM-HOME-011 — Artwork-less items hidden from rails
**Category:** Functional, Regression · **Priority:** P1 · **Platform:** Both
**Preconditions:** Catalog contains items without artwork.
**Steps:**
1. Compare rendered rails to raw catalog counts.
**Expected Result:** Items lacking artwork are filtered out via `useVisibleAlbums`/
`useVisibleRails`; rails may appear shorter than the raw data — this is expected, not a bug.

---

### JLM-HOME-012 — "Coming soon" empty state when the catalog is empty
**Category:** Functional, Boundary · **Priority:** P1 · **Platform:** Both
**Preconditions:** A catalog/feed with no browsable (English/legacy) content.

**Expected Result:** A "coming soon" empty state is shown rather than an error or a blank
feed; once catalog content is available, Home populates.

**Category:** Functional · **Priority:** P2 · **Platform:** Both
**Preconditions:** On Home.
**Steps:**
1. Tap the profile avatar.

language selection was removed; the header shows only the brand wordmark and the profile
avatar.)

---

### JLM-HOME-014 — Refresh preserves scroll/feed while updating
**Category:** UI/UX · **Priority:** P2 · **Platform:** Both
**Preconditions:** Home populated and scrolled.
**Steps:**
1. Trigger a background catalog update.
**Expected Result:** The feed updates without jarring scroll jumps or flicker; the persisted
`home.feed` cache means content shows immediately on next cold start.

---

### JLM-HOME-015 — Rapid chip switching is stable
**Category:** Performance, Regression · **Priority:** P2 · **Platform:** Both
**Preconditions:** Home populated with many categories.
